# MHD-shock-visuals-BSc
Python files used to create plots for my Bachelors thesis. 
The main file is the Plot_MHD.py it creates these Compilation pictures of all the shock parameters acquired from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. The functions F and G are mainly obtained with the help of these two sources: 
- Lecture for Heliophysics Summer School 2012 by Dana Longcope, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACzQjbLYKWE
- J. P. Goedbloed, Rony Keppens, and Stefaan Poedts. Advanced magnetohydrodynamics: with applications to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010.

The plot_MHD.py file has options at the begining to save, use latex font and change the plot range. If saving is set to false the interactive window has sliders to modify the plot in real time, but be patient.
